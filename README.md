# EmployeeViz

This repository contains a Business Intelligence Project. You will find the 2 SQL files (employee_mod and SQL.sql)
employee_mod is where the original dataset comes from. 
SQL.sql is my own SQL code for generating csv files to solve the business tasks_[1-4]

Please note, the dataset was obtain from GitHub and therefore, I do not own the original dataset.

In this project, I completed four business tasks:
1. Creating a visualisation to see the breakdown number of male and female employees in the company each year, starting from the year 1990

2. A comparison between the number of male and female managers from different departments each year, also starting from the year 1990

3. A comparison of the average salary between male and female employees in the different departments from the year 1990 - 2002

4. The average male and female salary per department within a certain salary interval. 

Please note that the SQL for Task. 4, I created a SQL program that allows users to find the average salary based on their desired salary range. 
In this project, I am interested to find the average salary of employees with salary range between $50,000 and $90,000

The tools used in this project are MySQL and Tableau Public. 
The visualisation (Employee Salary Viz) in Tableau can be found in this following link:
